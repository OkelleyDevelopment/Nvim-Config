# Nikolai's Nvim Config

## Motivation

My NeoVim setup that is meant to improve some quality of life functionality while still
retaining the overall sleekness the NeoVim offers. This refresh aims to harness the power
of the built in LSP that NeoVim 0.5+ offers.

### NOTE:

This configuration is by no means perfect and will continue to be updated as my work-flow
evolves.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following installed:

- NEOVIM (0.5+)


## Future updates
- [] LSP support
- [] autocomplete 
- [] Documentation update
- [] zen mode
- [] Bring in more colorschemes
- [] Install script
