# Initial Setup

Inside the `~/.config/` directory, run the command:

```sh
mkdir nvim
```

Now run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OkelleyDevelopment/Nvim-Configs.git
```

Then:

```bash
mv ~/.config/Nvim-Configs/* ~/.config/nvim/
```

Ensure the `.git` folder moved over too and you will have the needed assests.
